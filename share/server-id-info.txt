The recommended nomenclature for generating keyfiles for users with custom server instances is as follows:

A generic name part, identifying the file: TrekId
A 2-character enumerator that differs from any other server: XX.
Ex: TrekId23
This means that your hosted instance of the server will generate keyfiles by this name for every user.
Below you will see a list of servers and what 2-character numerical ID they use.
