# titrek-server
The server-side scripting for this project.

The server-side programming for Project TI-Trek. This is the meat of the game.
It enables clients to communicate with each other, to interact with the world and each other,
explore space, experience hazards, move, and much much more.


TO DO FOR "FULL BETA 1":
1) Fix space saving (still doesn't work)
2) Fully implement the compositing of terrain and entity data into frames for clients
3) Implement movement of entities (ships/projectiles -- basic only)
  -- ships can only fire forward for now (no lock-on)
4) Implement collision detection between entities and other entities/terrain objects
5) Handle damaging entity based on #5
